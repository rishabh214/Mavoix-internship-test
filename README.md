# Mavoix-internship-test
Shortlisting for interview of different roles using ML logistic regression algorithm
<br>
<br>

To test the project go to Driver section in the end of the file and provide necessary inputs <br>

<li>First I manipulated the data to create a seperate column for each skill(somewhat similar to pd.get_dummies)
<li>Those columns were later filled by 1 and 0 values on the basis of that particuar skill present.
<li>Check the 'x' dataframe to understand clearly</li>
<li>The user will provide for which role he/she wants to apply and his skillset.
<li>I made 3 different models using sklearn for 3 roles in this question .Task of each classifier was to predict whether person       is eligible for a interview for a particular role or not .
 <li>Model made prediction based on the type of skills a person has 
 <li> If a peson was not shortlisted for interview it showed the skills he/she lacked
