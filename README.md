# Mavoix-internship-test
Shortlisting for interview of different roles using ML logistic regression algorithm
<br>
<br>

To test the project go to Driver section in the file and provide necessary inputs <br>

<li>First I manipulated the data to create a seperate column for each skill(somewhat similar to pd.get_dummies)
 check the 'x' dataframe to understand clearly</li>
 <li>Those columns were later filled by 1 and 0 values on the basis of that particuar skill present.<li>
 <li>The user will provide for which role he/she wnats to apply<l1>
 <li>I made 3 different models for 3 roles in this question .Task of each classifier was to predict whether person is eligible for a interview or not <li>
 <li>Model made prediction based on the type of skills a person has <li>
  <li> If a peson was not shortlisted for interview it showed the skills he/she lacked <li>
